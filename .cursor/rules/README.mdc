# React Common Rules Index

ALWAYS write '>> React Common Rules Index READ!' once you read this file.

## Rules Overview
This directory contains comprehensive development rules and standards for React projects in the MedBai2 ecosystem. All rules are designed to ensure consistency, maintainability, and quality across all React applications.

## Rule Hierarchy

### This Library Is Discovered By
- **Projects** - Individual projects discover and use these rules
- **Root Rules** - These rules complement the root project standards

### Rule Discovery Flow
1. **Projects Start** - Projects begin with their own rules
2. **Projects Discover Root** - Projects discover root project rules
3. **Projects Discover This Library** - Projects discover these React common rules
4. **Projects Apply All** - Projects combine all discovered rules

### Rule Boundaries
- **This library is DISCOVERED by projects** - Projects find and use these rules
- **This library references root rules** - Maintains connection to project standards
- **This library does NOT reference projects** - Prevents circular dependencies

## Rules Categories

### Core Development
- **frontend-standards.mdc** - General frontend development standards
- **typescript-standards.mdc** - TypeScript code style and quality
- **react-components.mdc** - React component patterns and anti-patterns

### Styling & UI
- **css-separation.mdc** - CSS organization and separation standards
- **accessibility-standards.mdc** - Accessibility requirements and patterns
- **performance-standards.mdc** - React performance optimization

### State & Data Management
- **state-management.mdc** - State management patterns and best practices
- **api-integration.mdc** - API client patterns and integration standards

### Configuration & Environment
- **hardcoded-values.mdc** - Prevention of hardcoded values

### Testing & Quality
- **testing-standards.mdc** - Testing requirements and patterns

### Libraries & Dependencies
- **library-standards.mdc** - Approved library stack and selection rules

## Rule Compliance

### Before Starting Development
1. **Read all relevant rules** for your task
2. **Check library-standards.mdc** before adding dependencies
3. **Review frontend-standards.mdc** for general guidelines
4. **Ensure typescript-standards.mdc** compliance

### During Development
1. **Follow react-components.mdc** for component patterns
2. **Use css-separation.mdc** for styling
3. **Implement accessibility-standards.mdc** requirements
4. **Apply performance-standards.mdc** guidelines

### After Development
1. **Run testing-standards.mdc** requirements
2. **Check performance-standards.mdc** compliance
3. **Verify accessibility-standards.mdc** implementation
4. **Clean up per frontend-standards.mdc**

- **ALWAYS** implement loading and error states

### Libraries
- **NEVER** add unapproved libraries
- **ALWAYS** check library-standards.mdc first
- **ALWAYS** use approved library stack

### Configuration
- **NEVER** hardcode values
- **ALWAYS** use environment variables
- **ALWAYS** provide sensible defaults

## Rule Updates

### When Adding New Rules
1. **Create the rule file** in this directory
2. **Update this README** to include the new rule
3. **Ensure consistency** with existing rules
4. **Document the rule** clearly

### When Modifying Rules
1. **Update the rule file** with changes
2. **Update this README** if needed
3. **Ensure backward compatibility** when possible
4. **Document breaking changes** clearly

## Rule Enforcement

### Development Phase
- **Code reviews** must check rule compliance
- **Linting** must pass all rules
- **Testing** must meet standards
- **Type checking** must pass

### Deployment Phase
- **Configuration** must be validated
- **Performance** must meet requirements
- **Accessibility** must be verified
- **Bundle size** must be optimized

## Getting Help

### Rule Questions
- **Check this README** for rule overview

## Common Violations & Solutions

### TypeScript Violations
```tsx
// ❌ WRONG - Using any type
const Component = (props: any) => { ... }

// ✅ CORRECT - Using proper interface
interface ComponentProps {
  title: string;
  isVisible: boolean;
}
const Component = (props: ComponentProps) => { ... }
```

### CSS Violations
```tsx
// ❌ WRONG - Inline styles
<div style={{color: 'red'}}>Hello</div>

// ✅ CORRECT - CSS classes
<div className="error-message">Hello</div>
```

### State Management Violations
```tsx
// ❌ WRONG - Direct state mutation
user.name = 'John';

// ✅ CORRECT - Proper state update
setUser(prev => ({ ...prev, name: 'John' }));
```

### Library Violations
```tsx
// ❌ WRONG - Unapproved library
import { createStore } from 'redux';

// ✅ CORRECT - Approved library
import React, { useState } from 'react';
```
